<!-- Guess Game start game with an eventhandler 
var userguess = [] 
    use .push to add to the array 
update userguess as users guess letters 

We want:
    text: text + content, .innerhtml, 
    # of user's guesses: letters pushed to an empty array
    computer's guess: .random pick from an array with words
    if/else or switch/case
    write a function to reset the game without refreshing page or clearing wins/losses
        ex: letters, letters guessed, guesses left
    write a function to update wins and losses
    the function .INCLUDES is CASE-SENSITIVE so you have to use .TOLOWERCASE

    Arrays: letters, letters guessed, guesses left (# - guesses)
            maybe a random number generator to pull a random index from the array of potential answers for each game

    Events: key press to start game 
            read user's letter inputs
        
    Functions: 1. .includes to check if guess letter is included in word
                   update relevant arrays, like push guessed letter to letters guessed array
                   use .innerhtml to show letter guessed on screen
                   loops for number of guesses 
               2. tells you if you won or lost
               3. resets everything except wins/losses

    Help: Week-2/day 4/activity 10 (the crystal one) is apparently a lot like this homework

Example: Lunch
_ _ _ _ h

[x, y, z]

# guesses left: [5]

# wins: 2

# losses: 2
